# About Movie-project (Films-project)

In this project, I would like to present my know-how as a frontend developer. To begin with, this project uses a TMDB API which allows you to view movie trailers. It is designed to allow film lovers to search for a film that suits them in order to watch it entirely on a dedicated platform for this type of film.

## Types of technologies used
From building it to deploying it on github, it took me about a day. To do this, when building this project, I had used:
`axios`: a JavaScript library that makes it easy to send HTTP requests from the browser or Node.js;
`react-router-dom`: a React library that makes navigation and routing in React applications easier. It allows you to define routes for different React components, making navigation between application pages smoother.
`react-icons`: a React library that offers a diverse collection of ready-made icons from different popular icon libraries. It simplifies integrating icons into React applications, eliminating the need to manually download and include icon files.
`react-player`: a React library that makes it easy to integrate media players into React applications. It supports various media types such as videos and audios, and offers a simple API to control the player from your React application.
